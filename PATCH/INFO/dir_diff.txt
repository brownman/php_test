A note about working on an entire source tree

First, make a copy of the source tree:
## Original source code is in lighttpd-1.4.35/ directory ##
$ cp -R lighttpd-1.4.35/ lighttpd-1.4.35-new/
Cd to lighttpd-1.4.35-new directory and make changes as per your requirements:
$ cd lighttpd-1.4.35-new/
$ vi geoip-mod.c
$ vi Makefile
Finally, create a patch with the following command:
$ cd ..
$ diff -rupN lighttpd-1.4.35/ lighttpd-1.4.35-new/ > my.patch
You can use my.patch file to patch lighttpd-1.4.35 source code on a different computer/server using patch command as discussed above:
patch -p1 < my.patch
